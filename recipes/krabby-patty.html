                </ul>
            <h4>Sandwich</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 sesame seed buns, sliced in half</li>
                    <li>ketchup</li>
                    <li>mustard</li>
                    <li>1 jar dill pickle slices</li>
                    <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
                    <li>4 leaves of butter lettuce</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the Burger Patties: Heat a grill pan or sauté pan over medium heat. As it heats, combine ground beef, Old Bay, pepper and salt. Form into four equally sized patties, about 1/3 lb apiece. Set on a platter next to the stovetop. Coat the warmed grill pan with cooking spray and place patties on the pan, cooking each side about 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through to your desired doneness.</li>
                <li>Use a large star-shaped cookie cutter to cut each cheese slice into a star shape. Place the star-shaped cheese on each burger patty, in the last 30 seconds or so of cooking, so it melts a little. Set burger patties aside.</li>
                <li>Make King Neptune’s Poseidon Powder Aioli: Stir mayo and Old Bay until thoroughly combined.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Sandwich: Spread Poseidon Powder Aioli on the bottom of each bun. Top with a burger patty, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion slices, tomato and lettuce. Place the top bun on each burger. Serve.</li>
