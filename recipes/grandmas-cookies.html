        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
                <li>1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2-2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1-1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 package (12 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                <li>2 cups coarsely chopped walnuts, toasted</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>In a large bowl, beat butter and sugars until blended. Beat in eggs and vanilla. In a small bowl, whisk flour, baking soda and salt; gradually beat into butter mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
                <li>Shape 1/4 cupfuls of dough into balls. Flatten each to 3/4-in. thickness (2-1/2-in. diameter), smoothing edges as necessary. Place in an airtight container, separating layers with waxed paper or parchment; refrigerate, covered, overnight.</li>
                <li>To bake, place dough portions 2 in. apart on parchment-lined baking sheets; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 400Â°.</li>
                <li>Bake until edges are golden brown (centers will be light), 10-12 minutes. Cool on pans 2 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool.</li>
